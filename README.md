Financial Risk Assessment Project
Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict financial risk based on various features.
The model is designed to assist financial analysts in assessing the risk associated with different clients or financial products.
The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains over 15000 rows and  20 columns, including features related to financial metrics, customer information, and transaction history. The target variable indicates the level of financial risk.

Feature Engineering

The following feature engineering techniques were applied:

    Handling missing values
    Balancing imbalanced data
    Encoding categorical variables
    Creating new features to capture important patterns

Model Development

Several machine learning models were developed and evaluated to predict financial risk:

     Random Forest
     Support Vector Machine
     Gradient Boostng
     Logistic Regression
     Decision Tree Classifier
     K Neighbors Classifier

Model Evaluation

The models were evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. 
The Random Forest model showed the best performance with an accuracy of 70.36% and was selected for further tuning.

Results

The final model achieved an accuracy of 70.36% on the test dataset, making it a robust tool for financial risk assessment.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to predict financial risk, providing valuable insights for financial analysts and decision-makers.

Future Work

    Further tuning of hyperparameters to improve model performance.
    Integration of additional features to enhance predictive accuracy.
    Deployment of the model to a cloud platform for real-time risk assessment.
